# OpenVino-on-Aarch64

## Abstraction

### Intel OpenVino is a common toolset in the computer vision and machine learning field which provides straightforward and well-structured inference API and optimization tools.

### While the existing issue is that the intel does not happy to publish the ARM64 pre-built OpenVino packages for some unknown reason. 

### The motivation of this workaround is createing an automated continuous integration pipeline which defines the process to build OpenVino 2021.4+ ARM64 Docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system in Aarch64 Architecture.

### The performance of docker is closed to native in various aspects e.g. CPU, Disk .and the docker adapted flexibility while building image on huge VM and running on the edges.

## Infrastructure Flow Diagram

![OpenVino-on-Aarch64-Page-2.drawio (2)](https://minio.llycloud.com/image/uPic/image-20220114pUqDFC.png)

1. Commit the Infrastructure Code to Gitalb Instance in order to build OpenVino on Aarch64.
   The Dockerfile for build OenVino On Aarch64 is modified and captured from [OpenVino Docker-CI official Repository](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/docker_ci/tree/master/dockerfiles/ubuntu20/build_custom)

2. Build OpenVino on Aarch64 Image on Cloud VM, the Oracle Cloud has been used. The VM is leveraged by Oracle Cloud Always Free Tier.
   The VM have 4 A1 CPU (Arm), 24 GB memory, 200 GB Disk.

   The Runner configures with docker executor and use DIND (docker in docker topology) to build image.
   [https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html ](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html)

3. Push the OpenVino on Aarch64 image to the self-hosted [gitlab container registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/).

4. Pull the image from gitlab container registry on edge device (Raspberry Pi).
   ~~As the project in state of internal, only authorized user could pull this image.~~
   As approved by higher management, all of the procedures in this repositories is under general purpose practice, therefore the visibility of this repository has been changed to public. All of user could access pre-built image from ghcr.io (Github public container registry)
   
5. Run the image as a container on edge device (Raspberry Pi) and perform the Openvino object detection operations.

## Getting Start

### Installation

#### STEP 1 : Install OS

##### Download and Install Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS `ARM64`

[HERE](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04/release/ubuntu-20.04.3-live-server-arm64.iso) to donwload Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS ISO image ` ARM64`

##### Install Ubuntu 20.04

[HERE](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-ubuntu-20-04) is a guide for Ubuntu installation.

#### STEP 2 : Install Docker


```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

Inorder to run as non-root user, you have to run commands below.

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

If you still have some problem about permission. Try with

```sh
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
```

#### STEP 3 : Pull Docker image

**For public access**

```sh
export OpenVino_on_Aarch64_Image=ghcr.io/uaws/openvino-on-aarch64:latest
```

<details>
<summary>For Internal access</summary>

```sh
export OpenVino_on_Aarch64_Image=gitlab-registry.dev.vmv.re/akideliu/openvino-on-aarch64:latest
```

You need to make sure you have the access to the self-hosted gitlab container registry. Then Login to the registry.

https://gitlab.dev.vmv.re/AkideLiu/openvino-on-aarch64/container_registry

```sh
sudo docker login gitlab-registry.dev.vmv.re
```

</details>

Pull the latest version image

```sh
sudo docker pull $OpenVino_on_Aarch64_Image
```

#### STEP 4 : Run Docker image

#### Pre-requirements: you need set proper x11 forwarding on the both Client and edge system in order to retrieve the GUI functionality, and `xauth` packages needs to be installed via `apt` or `brew` 

```sh
sudo docker run -it \
   --privileged \
   -v /dev/video0:/dev/video0  \
   -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
   -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
   --device-cgroup-rule='c 189:* rmw' \
   -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb  \
   -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority \
   -d --net=host $OpenVino_on_Aarch64_Image
```

- `-it` : For interactive processes (like a shell), you must use `-i -t` together in order to allocate a tty for the container process. `-i -t` is often written `-it` as youâ€™ll see in later examples
- `--privileged` :  Give extended privileges to this container, in order to access host devices, camera and NCS2
- `-v /dev/video0:/dev/video0` : mapping the hosting video0 camera device to container
- `-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY` : x11 forwarding application docker support. This setting will allow to display graphic user interface to view the real time object detection.
- `-device-cgroup-rule='c 189:* rmw'` : NCS2 rules
- `-v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb` mapping the hosting usb device (NCS2) to container
- `-v $HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority` mapping the Xauthority from edge device into docker
- `-d` run on daemon
- `--net=host` support x11 for docker

### STEP 5 : Run Pre-built Sample application 

Run `sudo docker ps` to retrieve the container ID, in following example, the container ID is `8060f370a6cb`

```sh
(openvino) ubuntu@pi-home-01:~$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                     COMMAND        CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                                                                          NAMES
8060f370a6cb   gitlab-registry.dev.vmv.re/akideliu/openvino-on-aarch64   "/bin/bash"    6 hours ago   Up 6 hours                                                                                                    crazy_satoshi
```

Step into the OpenVino container

```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
```

Run the pre-build Open Model Zoo demo

```sh
cd ~/omz_demos_build/aarch64/Release/

./security_barrier_camera_demo \
   -d MYRIAD -d_va MYRIAD -d_lpr MYRIAD -nc 1 \
   -m /opt/intel/openvino/demos/security_barrier_camera_demo/cpp/intel/vehicle-license-plate-detection-barrier-0106/FP16/vehicle-license-plate-detection-barrier-0106.xml \
   -m_lpr /opt/intel/openvino/demos/security_barrier_camera_demo/cpp/intel/license-plate-recognition-barrier-0001/FP16/license-plate-recognition-barrier-0001.xml  \
   -m_va /opt/intel/openvino/demos/security_barrier_camera_demo/cpp/intel/vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039/FP16/vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039.xml
